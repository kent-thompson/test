        With all the practical and applied knowledge that I have acquired over the years, I feel I am a master, yet conversely, always a student, learning computer science. From <i>building VME/VXI mainframe based computers</i> for radar simulation, to building financial applications written completely in C++, to creating <i>embedded systems</i> in C, I have experienced a wide range of situations in my career, learned from them, and hope to continue to do so in the future. With decades of varied real-life experience, I am more than prepared for most situations. I will help your organization achieve its goals with these skills.

		<p><b>Design and Development Philosophy:</b><br>
		The <b><i>Agile Development Process</i></b> coupled with Scrum, Design Patterns, OOD and OOP have been very effective in meeting deadlines and exceeding expectations.
		</p>
		<p><b>The Right Tool for the Right Job:</b><br>
		Eschews the compiler, operating system and product "religious wars." Understands that just as a master architect should choose the right materials and tools to complete a contract correctly, so too should a professional software engineer. OS's and compilers are just tools to achieve the goals and objectives of an organization. Having worked extensively in hardware, I bring a unique perspective to engineering skills. That to be ever the "student of technology" and never become set in ones ways is at least one path to growth, personally and professionally.

	A Few Project Highlights:
	<p class="seodiv">Going through the Full Software Development Life-cycle (SDLC); Kent developed a complete <b>C#</b> Web-based, database driven, system that maintains all 17,000 street-lights for the City of Phoenix. We used <b>C#, SQL-Server and Tablet computers</b>. Data is entered one-time only and is then propagated system-wide where needed. Technicians enter real-time data into tablet computers,	in the field. This data is then updated, real-time, into all facets of the system where it can be viewed and acted upon.<br><br>
	The maintenance company has a "Command, Control and Maintenance Portal" and the City of Phoenix has its own portal and communication channel with the maintenance company. The company can access and communicate with any portal in the system, all real-time. Additional portals can be added for future expansion. Many other features and details can be explained upon request.</p>
	<p>For a DoD contractor I started with bare <b>Linux servers</b> and developed a full Linux  C / C++ development Tool-Chain that took us to full production systems. The product was a Linux based mobile surveillance system that incorporated <b>ARM and Atmel processors</b>, optical and infrared cameras, lasers, microcontrollers, MEMS, GPS and a host of exotic subsystems.</p>
	<p>I used Linux desktop x86 <b>(GCC / g++) Eclipse CDT development</b> systems, then used the CMake build system to create one code-base that ran on multiple hardware production systems with different processors, libraries, et cetera, for each unique hardware platform. <b>Design Patterns, OOD, OOP and Modern C++ techniques</b> were used to reduce unneeded code and improve reliability. Python was used to create internal testing, simulation, “stimulation” and GUI  (wxPython) visualization tools.
