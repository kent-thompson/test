	</ul>
	<p><b>ISO Standard C++</b><br/>
	Industry standard implementation of the C++ language and its many tools and libraries. Over twenty five years experience.
	</p>
	<p class="block-bg"><b>Microsoft Visual C++</b><i> Literally All Versions</i><br/>
	Microsoft's implementation of C++ and its many tools and libraries.
	</p>
	<p><b>ISO Standard C</b><br/>
	Industry standard implementation of the C language and its many tools and libraries. GCC being one example.
	</p>
	<p class="block-bg"><b>C# - .NET Architecture - .NET Framework - .NET Libraries</b> <i>Versions 1.0 to 4.8, .NET Core 2.2</i><br/>
	C# is a type-safe, object-oriented language. It is Microsoft's derivative of the Java language. It allows programmers to build a breadth of applications combined with the .NET Framework. C# can be used to create Windows applications, Web services, database tools, components, controls and more. First used in 2002 while on the Raytheon Architecture Team.
	</p>
	<p><b>Java</b><br/>
	First studied, analysed and used in 1997, a technical white paper was written for a giant industrial employer. Used a simple text editor and command-line tools to develop test programs. Given that it is a C++ derivative, it is very easy to use. Eclipse, Netbeans IDE. JCL, JFC, JSF, JPA, AWT, <b>Spring, Spring MVC, Spring Boot</b>, Swing, Struts 2, ORM, Hibernate, Annotations, Concurrency and many Design Patterns implemented successfully.
	</p>
	<p class="block-bg"><b>PHP</b><br/>
	PHP is a powerful, easy to use server side language. Successfully used it with MVC frameworks to create large scale database-driven dynamic web applications and SaaS Solutions. Great choice to use with JavaScript client side and AJAX / JSON.</p>
	<p><b>Python</b><br/>
	Python and wxPython have been used for a large array of tools for testing, internal applications, GUIs and support.
	</p>
	<p class="block-bg"><b>Perl</b><br/>
	Perl was used by Kent to write his first "compositing" website back in 1994 using CGI, HTML and a text editor. From that, have used Perl to go all the way to writing a C++ code-generator - in Perl - for a defense contractor, that ran an exotic large-scale machine control system. 
	</p>
	<p><b>SQL</b><i> - Structured Query Language</i><br/>
	A database computer declarative language designed for managing data in relational database management systems. DML, DDL, DCL, TCL, Data-Warehousing, Stored Procedures, Triggers and ETL are all understood and used. T-SQL and PL/SQL have also been extensively used.
	</p>
	<p class="block-bg"><b>ASP.NET - ASP "Classic"</b><br/>
	Active Server Pages (ASP) was Microsoft's first server-side script-engine for dynamically generated web pages. Used ASP to develop websites in the nineteen-nineties. Frankly, it was all a bit of a mess. ASP.NET uses the .NET framework and is considerably easier to use and facilitates compartmentalization of code.
	</p>
	<p><b>Delphi - Object Pascal - VCL</b><br/>
	Used Object Pacscal to write professional software before it became Delphi. Mainly Borland Object Pascal using the Object Windows Library.
	</p>
	<p class="block-bg"><b>Microsoft Visual Basic</b> through <b>Visual Basic.NET</b> and VBA<br/>
	Years of experience from the classic VB 6 (and earlier) to the newest VB.NET. Visual Basic for Applications ( VBA ) used many times when needed, usually in conjunction with MS-Access.
	</p>
	<p><b>Pascal</b><br/>
	Followed a fairly typical arc back then. Essentially, Basic to Pascal to C, while simultaneously learning (and using professionally) database languages (dBase for example), other programming languages, and many scripting languages.
	</p>
	<p class="block-bg"><b>Assembly</b><br/>
	Knowledge and skill-set that are still quite useful. Recently used for machine control, diagnostics and running an x-ray generator. Becoming a lost art and science. Kent's first computer also had an assembly module, which was the only way to program it if you didn't want to use Basic. Used off and on for many years.
	</p>
	<p><b>Basic Programming Language</b><br/>
	First computer ever used in 1982 had the Basic Language as its operating system. (It had nothing to do with Microsoft.) Have used it and its many variants many times thereafter in many settings.
	</p>	
	<p class="block-bg"><b>Many Scripting, Web, Graphic and Database Languages</b><br/>
	Bash, C shell (csh), Windows PowerShell, VBScript, Razor, Crystal Reports Programming Language, Lua, POV-RayTrace, Laszlo - LZX Language, Clarion, FoxPro, Paradox, Clipper, PowerBuilder, PowerScript, MUMPS, dBASE, DOS Batch Language... to name a few.
