    <p><b>The Problem Domain</b><br/>
    Analysing, studying and defining the Problem Domain at hand is vitally important. This needs to be done so one can understand and identify the <i>correct problem to solve</i> to successfully meet expectations and deadlines.</p>
    <p><b><span class="hilite">Understand:</span> The Problem Domain</b><br/>
    Gathering the facts and grasping the right problem to solve does not always have to be a lengthy process. Using Agile tools at our disposal, having pertinent product knowledge, hard won experience, talent and being honest in our evaluation of the situation is the key. Relying on a "canned solution" without it matching the true Problem Domain is a path to hardship.</p>
    <p><b><span class="hilite">Implement:</span> The Correct Toolchain</b><br/>
    Iterating quickly through what we have learned and <b>adapting to the problem domain</b>, we can now choose realistic and appropriate "tools." Not being locked into only one language through limited knowledge or being addicted to a favorite language or system is a huge advantage in solving real world problems successfully. Having vast experience and broad knowledge in software and systems are essential. Always using the same "knowledge set" for everything is not the answer. We have to use the correct tool-chain and knowledge set to solve the correct problems.</p>
    <p><b><span class="hilite">Develop:</span> Iterative Process</b><br/>
    There are numerous systems and "tools" that can be applied to this phase. Agile is popular currently and has proven its worth. This is an enormous topic and hard to summarize in a paragraph. Again, knowledge and experience facilitate making the right decisions during this phase. I strongly desire discussing it with a prospective client or employer.</p>
    <p><b><span class="hilite">Deploy:</span> Successfully</b><br/>
    Choosing the right deployment method, process and time are also important. Having made the correct decisions upstream, the first deployment is usually to be enjoyed, but also understood and monitored. In today's development world, deployment is also an iterative activity and will generally be an ongoing process to provide updates and customer requests. It should not be underestimated or an ad-hoc last minute activity.</p>

    <p><b><span class="hilite">Solutions:</span> The Right Tool for the Right Job</b><br/>
    Using one solution for every problem <i><b>is</b></i> a problem. As written above, it's imperative to solve the true problem and choose the correct tools, but it goes beyond that. During the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) it's important to make the right overall decisions along the path to completion. For example, sometimes the best solution is not to write any software at all, instead a phone call (communication) is what is required. Or to spend an hour writing a script rather than a week writing an application to solve a problem. Staying nimble, aware and having a diverse skill set and knowledge of multiple systems and languages makes choosing the "Right Tool for the Right Job" far easier.
