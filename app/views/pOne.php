	<p>This site represents a <strong>Service-Oriented Architecture with Microservices, an <i>Enterprise Web Application</i>, or Software As A Service (SaaS), not a Website.</strong><br>
	Simply, a Web Application is software that embodies an organizations processes and data. Websites, are generally, static information seemingly presented in three or four commonly used 'themes.' From this link an <a href="https://kentthompson.org/glossy2/index.html"> example website</a> we created can be seen.
	</p>
	<p><strong>Our Distributed, <i>API-Centric</i> Web Applications are Ultra Functional, Efficient and Extensible</strong><br>
    Emphasizing <i><b>API Design and API Security.</b></i> Built as dynamic and easily maintained web applications that scales with requirements and real-time demands. We've chosen usability, scalability and "function over form."
	</p>
	<p class="block-bg"><strong>Custom Software Solutions</strong><br>
	We provide complete software solutions to solve your business, graphic, scientific, <b>embedded</b>, engineering, web application, and internet needs. From engineering systems written entirely in C / C++ and assembly for high performance precision computing or real-time machine control, to dynamic and responsive large scale database driven <i>Web Applications</i> based business solutions. We can provide a solution to help achieve your organizations goals.
	</p>
	<p><strong>Web Application Example</strong><br>
	This Model-View-Controller (MVC) based web application structure can be quickly built out to accommodate a large number of database driven data input forms and pages. It is dynamic, extensible and easily programmed. Data integrity, security, ease of use, and correctness are essential for its success. It is also responsive.
	A more traditional "themed" <i><a href="https://kentthompson.org/glossy2/index.html"> example website</a></i> can be seen here.</p>

	<p class="block-bg"><strong>Complete Full Software Development Life Cycle Support</strong><br>
	Kent Thompson Consulting offers many software services, and in all of them, we offer a full spectrum of experience and knowledge to make your software project a success. We have successfully been through many real-world Software Development Life Cycles (SDLC) with many different types of applications.
	</p>
	<p><strong>Systems Analysis, Planning and Architectural Design</strong><br>
	With decades of experience in object-oriented design (OOD) and object-oriented programming (OOP) we can provide a state of the art design and long term extensible architecture to suit any situation. Coupled with extensive experience with large scale databases, we have a long history of taking customer concepts, needs and ideas and turning them into a successful productive system that works "twenty-four seven."
	</p>
	<p class="block-bg"><b>Project Management and Documentation</b><br>
	Many years experience with managing complex projects, most including people with varying levels of expertise and technical knowledge. Clear and concise document creation, control and maintenance can be essential for success. Years of experience with gathering requirements from non-technical personnel to writing engineering requirements documents, design documents, test plans to final end-user documentation or a book. Years of <i>Agile</i>, Scrum, Six Sigma and ISO-9000/9001 experience.
	</p>
	<p><b>Application Creation</b><br>
	New applications designed, written and maintained using proven principles of Software Engineering.
	</p>
	<p class="block-bg"><b>Application Maintenance</b><br>
	We can maintain existing source code and extend programs written by anyone and maintain them using state of the art principles of Software Engineering.
	</p>
	<p><b>Application Testing, Documentation and Maintenance</b><br>
	Again, we can and do support the project for its entire product life cycle - or any phase of it.
	</p>
	<p class="block-bg"><b>System / Application Deployment</b><br>
	We can help get the system/application onto the users desktop in many ways, including automating the process so the user need not be involved.
	</p>
	<p><b>Hire Us On Contract or Full-Time</b><br>
	We are a great work "over-flow" alternative. Hire us instead of hiring a full-time employee to handle those deadlines. Short or long duration contracts can be accommodated. Or full-time positions can be considered.
	Again, we can, and do support the project for its entire product life cycle - or any phase of it the client desires.
