A normal fixed positioned element would be “out of context” and is very difficult to use in the most common situations with fluid designs. This plugin solves that problem with as little code as I could possible get it so it will run in the most optimized way, while also allow you to customize it in many important ways which might suit you best.","body":"##Benefits\r\n\r\n* Can handle many floated elements, each with it’s own settings\r\n* Floated elements’ movement can be bound inside their parents’ area\r\n* Uses Native JavaScript easing, or CSS3 hardware accelerated transitions (not for IE)\r\n* Has many settings, such as stick to the bottom or animation style\r\n* Code is very maintainable and highly efficient\r\n\r\n##Basic initialization\r\n    jQuery('.menu').stickyfloat( {duration: 400} );\r\n    \r\n##Update (change settings for a specific element)\r\n    jQuery('.menu').stickyfloat('update',{duration : 0, stickToBottom:true });\r\n\r\n##Destroy (no more floating)\r\n    jQuery('.menu').stickyfloat('destroy');\r\n\r\n##Parameters\r\n\r\n### duration (200)\r\nThe duration of the animation\r\n\r\n### startOffset (number)\r\nThe amount of scroll offset after the animations kicks in\r\n\r\n### offsetY (number)\r\nThe offset from the top when the object is animated\r\n\r\n### lockBottom (true)\r\nSet to false if you don’t want your floating box to stop at parent’s bottom\r\n\r\n### stickToBottom (false)\r\nMake whatever that is “floating” sticl top the bottom instead to the top \r\n\r\n### delay (0)\r\nDelay in milliseconds until the animnations starts  \r\n\r\n### easing (linear) \r\nEasing function (jQuery has by default only ‘swing’ & ‘linear’) \r\n\r\n### cssTransition (false)\r\nif you wish to manualy set your own CSS3 transion styles on the floated element, flag this setting as ‘true’\r\n"}
